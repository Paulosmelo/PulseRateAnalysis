# PulseRateAnalysis
This project was created to help me to learn how to use python for data and javascript for data visualisation. It is a web page  that shows data from a analysis about pulse rates and exercises. 

# About the data
I get the data from a list of datasources made to help students who are learning about data science. If you want know about it, follow the  link bellow.

# Data 
How I already said, It is going to be use python to reads the data and insert it in a sqlite database. The python file is going to fill the data base and after that another python file is gonna read it and creates json.

# Data visualisation 
It going to be use js to get the json files and shows it in the web page.

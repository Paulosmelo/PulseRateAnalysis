# Resume:
This project was created to help me to learn how to use python and javascript for data visualisation. It is a web page that shows data from a analysis about pulse rates and exercises. 

# About the data:
I get the data from a list of datasources made to help students who are learning about data science. If you want know about it, follow the  link bellow.

# Data:
It is going to be use python to reads the data and insert it in a sqlite database. The python file is going to fill the data base and after that another python file is gonna read it and creates js file with objects.

# Data visualisation:
It going to be use a js library (chart.js) to get the js file and create a bubble chart.


# Required:
Python and Sqlite.

# Tutorial:

Step 1: Run "model.py" to create a database and insert date into it.

Step 2: Run "controller.py" to create a js file with the objects.

Step 3: Open index.html in you browser .
